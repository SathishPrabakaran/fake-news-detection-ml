# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging text preprocessing and ensemble learning, the model aims to classify news as **real** or **fake** with high accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Fake News Dataset  
- **Content:** News articles with corresponding labels (`fake` or `real`)  
- **Target:** Binary classification – Detect whether a news article is fake or not  

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization and text cleaning  
   - TF-IDF vectorization to extract features  

2. **Model Building:**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - XGBoost Classifier  
   - Ensemble approach combining predictions  

3. **Training & Optimization:**
   - Trained models with cross-validation  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved **95% accuracy** using an ensemble of Logistic Regression and XGBoost  
- TF-IDF vectorization enhanced feature representation  
- Strong classification performance for real-world text data
